It was three day ago, at 7:00 PM and John, my brother, was driving home from work. He had been looking forward to getting home to see his family and relax after a long day. He was driving on a busy highway, and traffic was heavy. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a car came speeding into his lane and hit him head-on. John's car spun out of control, and he felt a sharp pain in his chest as his seatbelt tightened. The airbags deployed, and he heard the sound of metal crunching. His car finally came to a stop on the side of the road, and he was trapped inside. He was dazed and confused and could feel the blood running down his face from a cut on his forehead. The other driver was also injured, and he stumbled out of his car. The police arrived shortly after, and the paramedics were called to the scene. John was carefully extracted from his car, and he was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries. He is at the hospital recovering in the hospital with broken ribs, a collapsed lung and head injury with couple of stitches.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
